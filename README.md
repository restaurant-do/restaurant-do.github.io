# How to Use

Simply fork this repository and start editing the `_config.yml` file!

> NOTE: GitHub Actions is required to deploy to GitHub Pages because GitHub [refuses to update their version of Jekyll](https://github.com/github/pages-gem/issues/651).

# Added Features

* **[Formspree.io](https://formspree.io/) contact form integration** - just add your email to the `_config.yml` and it works!
* Use `_config.yml` to **set whether the homepage tiles should pull pages or posts**, as well as how many to display.
* Add your **social profiles** easily in `_config.yml`. Only social profiles buttons you enter in `config.yml` show up on the site footer!
* Set **featured images** in front matter.
